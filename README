Thanks for checking out Twitboard Alpha!
This system uses Python to fetch tweets using the Tweepy API.

Be sure to create a twitter API key first and insert it in the file tweet.py
The following lines should be changed to your API codes
ckey = ''
csecret = ''
atoken = ''
asecret = ''

Then download the Tweepy-Master from Github (Download here: https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
And extract it to the twitboard directory!

Usage: python tweet.py
When asked enter the keyword you want the live stream to show.

Setup your MySQL credentials in "call.php" and import the database from "twitboard.sql"

Browse to your twitboard installation using your browser: http://yourhost/twitboard/board.php and see if everything works right.
It may take up to several minutes before the stream starts showing live tweets!

If the demo message won't go away you can manually remove it from the database
